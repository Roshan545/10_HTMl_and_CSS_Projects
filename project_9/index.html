                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
                language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host
                environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
                connected to the objects of its environment to provide
                programmatic control over them.
              </p>
              <p>
                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as
                Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such
                as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
                JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
                supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="a2_1_3">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                  objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                  (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an
                  application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to
                  user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                  navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                  objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For
                  example, server-side extensions allow an application to
                  communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
                  from one invocation to another of the application, or perform
                  file manipulations on a server.
                </li>
              </ul>

              JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
              different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java
              but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
              JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
              and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
              renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </div>
            <div class="a2_3_3 as a2_1_2">
              In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
              declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a
              small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and
              string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
              instead of the more common class-based object model. The
              prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what
              is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
              supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
              Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
              methods.

            <div class="a2_3_4 as a2_1_2">
              JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do
              not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do
              not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private,
              or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
              Variables, parameters, and function return types are not
              explicitly typed.

              To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and

              You use variables as symbolic names for values in your
              application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
              to certain rules.
            </div>
            <div class="sd3">
              A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_),
              or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits
              (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
              characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a"
              through "z" (lowercase).

              You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
              identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
              characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
              Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
